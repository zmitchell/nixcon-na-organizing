# Karaoke

This is fun and it lets you see a side of people you don't normally see at the
conference.

Ideally karaoke is within walking distance of the venue.
Last time karaoke was a 15 minute drive,
which I think hurt attendance.

Depending on expected attendance and the size of the karaoke venue,
you might want to buy the place out.
Some locations won't let you do this at all.
If you start the conversation early enough and starting throwing numbers around
that may change some minds.
We didn't buy the place out last time and it was fine.

Do not go to a cash-only location, it's just a headache.
Do not go toa  location that only has private karaoke rooms,
the whole point is for everyone to meet each other and have fun.
Normal karaoke patrons that aren't part of the conference can also fill in gaps
when the conference attendees are feeling nervous.
