# Engagement

This section is about how we get attendees to connect with each other.

One way is to have a QR code on the attendee's badge with a vCard on it so that
attendees can scan each other's badges to get their contact info.

Another way is to assign each attendee a "store path"
(`/nix/store/<5 character hash>`).
The idea is that there's a fixed number of these store paths,
and you're supposed to go find the other people with that store path.
