# Proctoring

This section explains the duties of a room proctor.

These instructions are in chronological order leading up to the time of the talk.
This timeline is optimistic based on everything going well; if there is a problem, you will likely spend all your time dealing with that.
That is fine and it is what you are there to assist with.

## What is proctoring?

Your job as a room proctor is to ensure the talk goes well for both the speaker and the audience.
Your duties include:

- Being the liaison to AV and operations.
- Introducing and thanking the speaker.
- Ensuring that things run on schedule.

## Timeline

### 20 Minutes Before

- Check if the speaker is in the room (assuming you can recognize them).
  If you don’t see them, then email/message them a reminder that their talk is soon.
- Set yourself up with a chair in the front row of seats, where the speaker can clearly see you.

### 10 Minutes Before

- Once the prior speaker is finished, sanitize the mic.
- Help the speaker put on the mic.
- Help the speaker get their laptop connected to video and make sure it’s working.
  - Swap dongles, if required
  - Make a run for AV staff, if required
  - Make sure their laptop is plugged in or fully charged as well as any other equipment needed for their talk.
- If the speaker needs network help or other tech support, help with that
- Make sure the speaker has water.
- If you have time, go slightly outside the door of the room and loudly announce the upcoming talk to the hallway.

### 5 Minutes Before

- Ask the speaker:
  - How to pronounce their name
  - How they want to be introduced (title, company, organization?)
  - How they want to handle questions (Any time during the talk? Only at the end?) and coordinate mic runners.
- Help fill dead time for the audience by conversing with the speaker, asking questions, making jokes, or other appropriate activities.

### Start of the Talk

- Announce the speaker. Example text below. Tailor it as necessary.
- End the announcement by applauding, so that the audience claps too, to welcome the speaker.

> Welcome to {event name}!
> Our next talk is {name of talk} by {speaker name(s)}.
> {speaker name} is a {job title/project role} for {organization/project}.
> They are here to share their knowledge on {subject}.
> We will take questions at the end of the presentation.
> Please welcome them!
>
> [applause]

### Just After the Start

- Close the door to the hallway, if you haven’t already.
- Take up your position in the first row of seats.

### During the Talk

- Monitor the speaker and be ready to troubleshoot problems.
- When the speaker gets down to 10, 5, and 1 minute left, flash the cards warning them.

### Q&A Period

- Start the Q&A period with an announcement and call for applause. Example text below.
- Run the extra mic to folks asking questions, so that their questions get on the recording.  This also helps regulate questioners.
- Assist the speaker with bad questioners (“This is more of a comment”), including cutting them off.
- If the audience are slow to ask questions, ask one or two yourself.

> Thank you so much for that presentation!
> We have {number of minutes left} minutes for some questions.
> If you have a question, raise your hand, and I will bring the mic to you so you can ask.
> What’s the first question?

### After the Talk

- When the questions wind down, or time runs out, announce the end of the talk and the next talk. Example text below.
- Call for applause.
- Help the speaker disconnect their stuff so that the next speaker can set up, unless they are right before a break.
- If the speaker gets tied up with talking to attendees make sure they move along in time for the next talk. They need to be out at least 5 minutes before the next talk.

> Thanks everyone, for attending {name of talk}.
> Coming up next is {name of next talk}, so stick around.
> And thank you, {speaker name}, for sharing!
>
> [applaud]
