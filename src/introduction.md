# Introduction

Feel free to add your thoughts, pointers, etc,
but try to keep to the same general structure.

If there's a timeline associated with the area you're describing,
put that in a `##` section at the end of the page.


## Logistics

### Rooms
- good to have space outside the rooms, to do chaotic things and self organize
- the downstairs is out of the way, gives more freedom. Ballrooms might provide more space
- Conference Center: we got people looking for SCALE registration
- Not set up specifically for workshop-style

### AV:
- needed lights dimmed
- screen size not enough for size of room
- talks had a small popup
- Can we pre-arrange for better AV setup?
- tell presenters to be prepared with "dark/light mode"
- coach speakers on mic technique.
  - Preparation time, or coordination meeting
- number of mics: ask up front how they will choreograph
  - can we ask SCALE for 3 mics? easier for Q+A
- SPEAKERS need to repeat question
  - have people get up, stand in line, and ask questions
  - tight rows discourages this


### Program
- run-throughs: improves quality, speaker coaching 
  - needs more volunteers
- before opening ceremony; do mic checks
- intermediate talks vs advanced talks
  - intentionally had beginner-friendly talks
- unconference
  - new users Q+A was good
  - chairs were connected
  - can do additional rounds next time

### Branding
- Hand out Nix-logo stickers to frontdesk/registration?
- CfP did not have NixCon logo, DESIGN IT EARLIER
- Make Signs
- Bring a banner (@dan)!
- make more stickers

### t-shirts, swag
- many not picked up, gave away ~50% during SCALE
- no mug!?

### signs
- were not there on first day before noon
- used whiteboards instead and "people power"
- We started very early in the day.


### People
- people coming just for NixCon, not SCALE
- create volunteer schedule beforehand
  - setup
  - registration - 
  - t-shirts
  - teardown + cleanup

### Scheduling
- first day had more attendance due to less contention with SCALE
- Might be okay to bleed into Sat due to work schedules and crowd.
- note: 4 days of conferencing .... is a lot .... so tired .... :(
- who owned what? was unclear
  - assigned leads/captains for areas

### Committee
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility
- define roles MUCH earlier.... eg: X months earlier
- asking for volunteers very early, but hard to hand-off high-responsibility roles
- Call-for-Papers <+++> Call-for-Organizers
- enumerate the roles
- add COMMS role

### Engagement
- own badges
    - vCards can be put on our own badges.
    - Potential confusion
    - more branding
    - custom lanyards
- connecting people to each other
- "beginners booth" - "happiness bar": dedicated answerers, need shifts
- "volunteer lanyard" - was not used much
- ApacheCon, badge/flair/sticker shows what kind of focus someone has
  - Nixpkgs, Nix, NixOS, docs ....
- stickers/ribbons: first-time, open to talk, don't talk, pronouns
  - "Build-a-badge corner"

 ### Karaoke
 - 15 min drive is too far + mode of transport switch
 - cash-only was a pain
 - ~30 people showed up
 - perhaps was too late, 9pm
 - motivating activity that people looked forward to

### Sponsors
- defined criteria up-front prior to prospectus
- sponsor communication plan (1 week, 2 week prior, promote event, etc)
- refine tiers
- unclear when sponsors will be on signage, timing, what is produced, deadlines
- stricter deadlines (relates to signage)

### Budget
- 10k surplus
  - give some/all back is related to deciding to stay in same location
- foundation or next year or t-shirts or mugs

### Next steps/year
- SCALE co-location saves lots of money
- seemed beneficial, common sentiment
- part of wider Linux community
- NixOS VMs with the vending machine! Good way to give people a shell.
- ~~Waiting~~Installing is the hardest part!!!
- Framework relationship + ask for sponsorship (and modules)
- Get the word out, SNUG, LUG, System76
- Local Cache. Github API rate-limits. Peer-to-peer cache.
- "Where is Nix being used?" SCALE itself + more
  - flyers, brochures, 1/2 pager "What is Nix", reference card
  - Marketing team
- "Where do I start?"
  - nix.dev vs zerotonix vs nixacademy: focus on official
  - useful vs marketing
  - TODO: Provide feedback from event to docs team.. document flakes
    - alternative: pointers to other locations
    - lots of blogs/videos and alternatives to official
    - installer has similar considerations

### Food and bev
- need more water!
- coffee
- did we have snacks? bagels, cookies
- could have more, hard to predict
- last-minute soda order, more DIET
- water-coolers hard to find
- SCALE location was good for lunch + dinners
- breakfast items?
- convention center does not like external food brought in
- provide list of local venues
- schedule 1.5 hours for lunch to allow flexibility 
- Enough coffee? Yes.

### Comms
- too many platforms, Matrix, Email, Discourse, Whatsapp
- Have an Organizers+Volunteers Channel
  - existing room had too many people for SCALE coordination
- Have an Attendees Channel!!! or an email listing.
- Online and Sharing
  - people didn't know there was a live stream
- Need COMMS role.
  
### Registration
- better way to distinguish SCALE vs NixCon
- recorded t-shirt sizes
- separate registration from SCALE?
  - becomes complicated, needs discussion + research
  - idea: NixCon provides coupon code for SCALE
  - coordinating earlier might help here

### Survey
- results? 31 responses, needed to be emailed out, footers, social
- positive responses so far

### Swag or Signage or Misc
- extra and disposal: given to local group
- organizer-specific shirts?
- lanyards didn't quite work out

### Guix
- extend co-co-locate offer? Might be too much.
- offer a talk slot? Possible
- mention "immutable track"
- TODO: reach out (@tomberek)

###
Bravo to everyone!!!!
Ya'll are amazing.
Great job!
Thanks for all the fish.
"All the energy of an uncontained fire, in a good way, crispy."
Good feedback from attendees.

Created a K8S cluster from vending machine
  - Scoreboard boasting
  - final: ~230 NixOS vs ~120 Rocky vs ..others..
  - filled up a full node the first day, they added another node
