# Comms

We absolutely need a way to send messages to all the attendees.
That was sorely lacking the first time around.

We also need a plan for regularly making social media posts about selected
speakers, sessions, etc.

The Matrix channel is a good place to field questions,
but most people aren't on Matrix,
and it became unclear whether that was a space for organizing or for
attendees to congregate.
