# Data

- We need a list of registered attendees
    - We also need their shirt size (didn't get that this time around)
- If we have a scanner for "lead generation" post someone outside the room so
  they can scan people on their way into the talk.
    - Only scanning people who ordered shirts will undercount walk-ins.
- Maybe offer scanners to sponsors at a certain tier?
