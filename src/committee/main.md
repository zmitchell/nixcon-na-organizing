# Committee

This is the organizing committee for the conference.
Diffusion of responsibility happens naturally when no one in particular is
assigned to a given task.

A couple of roles that need to exist:
- Chair
    - The person making sure everything is proceeding in a timely manner
- Ops
    - Tracking down vendors, placing orders, getting information from people
- Sponsors
    - Let's get that money
- On the ground (OTG)
    - See the venue
    - Recruit local volunteers
    - Find local food recommendations
