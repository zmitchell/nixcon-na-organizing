# Unconf

This is discussion time that's intentionally unstructured.

- Grab whiteboards or post-it notes
- Give attendees a couple of minutes to submit their discussion topics
- Allow submitters 10 seconds to describe their topics
- Give attendees a couple of minutes to vote on the topics they want to discuss (1 or 2 votes each works well)
- Take the top `N` topics
- Send each topic to a different part of the room/venue

Having whiteboards on hand is nice because it lets someone take notes.
You can also have one person take notes and post them somewhere.
